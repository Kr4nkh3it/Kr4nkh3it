Yo I'm Krankheit and this is a whole text file about me, NICE.
Currently I am 16, although that's not useful information. I really love computers and learning about them, I like how intricate but also how simple they can be.
I'm mainly a programmer and the two main languages I know are C and Python but I plan on learning c++ soon enough. I'm interested in cyber security, my main goal is
to be a penetration tester. I like cyber security because it wraps up a lot of knowledge about computers into one field and has you kind of dismantle the logic behind
them so that you can break them(for good purposes obviously).
